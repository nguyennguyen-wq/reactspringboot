Add or edit the .npmrc file in your project folder and add the option:
node-options="--openssl-legacy-provider"

A Simple way through NPM.
We can set the SSL legacy option in the .npmrc file.

In my case Node.JS v18 with npm v9.

Add or edit the .npmrc file in your project folder and add the option:
node-options="--openssl-legacy-provider"

Advantages:
It can be managed per project
The .npmrc file in the project will remind us that the project needs to be updated.
If that appears in another project on the server we will still have the error.


For me unsetting NODE_OPTIONS alone didn't solve the problem. I had to use

nvm use v18
to solve the issue.


Just run this command
unset NODE_OPTIONS



This problem appeared after an update, sudo apt upgrade, on Ubuntu 20.04 (Focal Fossa).

Previously, I worked on versions Node.js v18.0.0 and npm 8.7.0, but after the update there was a problem. I ran command nvm install node --reinstall-packages-from=node, but it did not help.

Now I use npm v8.12.1 and Node.js v18.4.0.

When running the command npm start, I receive the message:

> mini-app@0.0.0 start
> cross-env PORT=10888 HTTPS=false react-scripts start --openssl-legacy-provider

node: --openssl-legacy-provider is not allowed in NODE_OPTIONS
part of a file, package.json, looks like this :

 "scripts": {
    "start": "cross-env PORT=10888 HTTPS=false react-scripts start --openssl-legacy-provider",
    "build": "react-scripts build",
    "predeploy": "npm run build",
    "deploy": "vk-miniapps-deploy",
    "tunnel": "vk-tunnel --insecure=1 --http-protocol=https --ws-protocol=wss --host=localhost --port=10888"
  },

How does Spring pageable work?
In Spring Data, if we need to return a few results from the complete data set, 
we can use any Pageable repository method, as it will always return a Page. 
The results will be returned based on the page number, page size, and sorting direction.22. jul. 2022


A page is a sublist of a list of objects. It allows gain information about the position of it in the containing entire list.
